## Spheres
Artist Archetypes exist within Spheres that define their creative gravity.
## Artist Archetype Definition

An Artist Archetype defines the structural form through which a Legendary Raveliquar exists.

It governs:
- How creativity manifests in the world
- How magic is expressed
- How story and agency unfold
- How shadow and luminary forces distort or elevate behavior

Artist Archetypes are not identities themselves.
They are the form that identity inhabits.
