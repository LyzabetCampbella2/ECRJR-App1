# ECRJR — Archetype Index v1 (Launch)

ECRJR v1 launches with five primary archetypes.
These represent distinct creative identity patterns, not hierarchies or roles.

## Archetypes
1. [Name TBD]
2. [Name TBD]
3. [Name TBD]
4. [Name TBD]
5. [Name TBD]

## Notes
- Each archetype must be non-overlapping.
- Each must produce different shadow and luminary expressions.
- No archetype is superior to another.
