# ECRJR — Narrative Axes

A Narrative Axis represents the dynamic tension between a Shadow Aspect and its paired Luminary Aspect.

Each Legendary Raveliquar expresses exactly five Narrative Axes.

## Axis Components
- Shadow Aspect
- Luminary Aspect
- Tension Pattern
- Story Pressure
- Magic Behavior
- Resolution Path

## Rules
- Axes generate narrative, not morality.
- Shadow and Luminary coexist; neither eliminates the other.
- Axes describe movement, not states.
