# ECRJR — Composite Archetypes

Composite Archetypes represent the highest-order creative identity resolved by the Raveliquarith system.

They are not selected or scored.
They are generated through the convergence of archetypal signals, shadow states, and luminary states.

## Properties
- Narrative-grade
- Stable but evolving
- Recognizable as identity
- Expressed through language, metaphor, and pattern

## Quantity
The system supports a large theoretical space of Composite Archetypes.
Only a limited subset is revealed at launch.

## Role
Composite Archetypes function as the primary identity result presented to the user.
