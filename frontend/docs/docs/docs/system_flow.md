## Stage Responsibilities

Foundational Tests:
- Collect responses
- Produce raw signals
- Do not interpret meaning

Shadow & Luminary Aspects:
- Represent pressure and coherence states
- Are selected, not evaluated

Artist Archetype:
- Defines form of expression
- Does not assign identity

Narrative Axes:
- Describe tension and movement
- Do not resolve outcomes

Raveliquarith:
- Interprets all prior structures
- Produces name, legend, and judgment
- Is the sole interpretive authority

Frontend:
- Renders content
- Does not compute meaning
- Does not compare results
